Overview of the Project

Project: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA) ON DIWALI SALES DATA

Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing diwali sales data which includes customer name,product,age,gender,amount,etc. 
The aim is to uncover insights into diwali sales,distributions, correlations, and outliers through visualizations.

Key Activities
1) Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
2) Data Visualization: Creating Visualization to understand data distributioons, trends, and relationships.
3) Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlation between diwali sales figures across many customers.

Technologies Used
1) Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
2) pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
3) matplotlib: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
4) seaborn: Utilized for naking statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.

Key Insights
1) Loading Dataset.
2) Data cleaning and preparation.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis using libraries like pandas, numpy,
and matplotlib or seaborn.

Conclusion
EDA is the most important part of any analysis. You will get to know many things about your data. 
You will find answers to your most of the questions with EDA. I have tried to show most of the python functions used for exploring the data with visualizations.
Thus from this Task 1 of EDA data analytics instership I have learned how to start with the dataset of your choice and learned to perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy,
and matplotlib or seaborn. Learned how to explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers and also learned how to visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.
